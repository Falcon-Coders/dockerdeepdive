## Session Aim

To provide a deeper knowledge of the Docker platform

---

## Agenda

- Isolation<br>
- Networking<br>
- Persisting data<br>
- Custom images<br>
- Docker Compose<br>

---

# Isolation

---

## Container Isolation

>Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly 
>despite differences for instance between development and staging
(https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)

---

## Control Groups

Ensures a single container cannot consume all<br>
resources of the host<br>
<br>
Implements resource limiting of:-
- CPU
- Memory

---

## Namespaces

Control what a container can see<br>
<br>
Used to control:-<br>
- Hostname within the container
- Processes that the container can see
- Mapping users in the container to users on the host

---

## File system

- Containers cannot see the entire host's filesystem<br>
- They can only see a subset of that filesystem<br>
- The container root directory is changed upon start up

---

# Demo

---

# Networking

---

## Default networks

<img src="assets/images/docker_default_networks.png" style="float: right"/>

- bridge<br>
- host<br>
- none<br>

---

## Bridge network

Default network<br>
Represents _docker0_ network in the host network stack<br>
Containers communicate by IP address<br>
Supports port mapping 

---

## User defined networks

Docker provide multiple drivers<br>
Enables DNS resolution of container names to IP addresses<br>
Can be connected to more than one network<br>
Connect/disconnect from networks without restarting<br>

---

# Demo

---

# Persisting data

---

## Options for persisting data

- Bind mounts<br>
- Data volume containers<br>
- Named volumes

---

# Demo

---

# Custom images

---

## Building your own image

- Custom images built from a file containing instructions<br>
- Known as a dockerfile<br>
- Customise the image to grant permissions to directories<br>
- Add databases to SQL Server, ready to go when container starts<br>

## What is Compose?

>Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
>With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. 
>Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.](docs.docker.com/compose
